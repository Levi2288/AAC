# README

Hey, Im looking for sourcepawn coders.
I started working not very long  ago on an anticheat framework and sadly i cant do it alone on an acceptable speed so im asking the sourcemod community.
Im down for new ideas & everything that can help us keep going

This going to be a public & open source project if you want to help PM me :D

**Whats the goal:**

To make the ultimate anticheat with module support so anyone can add there own prevention/detection methods.

Not just detect and punish the cheaters, but also block the cheating method they are using,w making it completly useless if they can outplay the anticheat.


# if you want to help

Dont be toxic
Know Sourcepawn basics

# FAQ

- How can i help?
 
    You can help me in the Framework or with the modules (detecting & preventing cheats)
    
- Do i get paid or any benefits helping you?

  No, as mentioned above this is a **Community** project. Open **Source** and **Free** to use for everyone. If you count credit as a benefit then yeah u gonna get credited in the repo and alliedmodders post.
  
- Why would i help? 

  Cuz please? And i think we deserve a really good anticheat that is free and reliable
