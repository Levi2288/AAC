Hey, Im looking for sourcepawn coders.
I started working not very long  ago on an anticheat framework and sadly i cant do it alone on an acceptable speed so im asking the sourcemod community.
Im down for new ideas & everything that can help us keep going

This going to be a public & open source project if you want to help PM me :D

**Whats the goal:**

To make the ultimate anticheat with module support so anyone can add there own prevention/detection methods.
Dummy friendly 
Not just detect and punish the cheaters, but also block the cheating method they are using,w making it completly useless if they can outplay the anticheat
